# Simple Godot Code Library

Welcome to the Simple Godot Code Library!
This repository is designed to help developers by providing a collection of reusable code snippets and functions that I created over time.

## Overview

This library is written 100% in GdScript, the coding language for Godot. Each script comes with a version number.
Please note that discrepancies between the code version and the editor version may or may not cause the code to malfunction. 
Important Scripts may get Updated over time, if so you will see newer versions of the code first in the file and older afterwards.

## Documentation and Comments

I did my best to comment on most of the code within the library.
These comments are intended to provide context, making it easier for users to understand how the code works and how to implement it in their own projects.
However, while the library is a helpful resource, I strongly encourage you to write your own code rather than relying solely on copy-pasting.
This practice will enhance your understanding of GdScript and improve your coding skills.
Most if not all Code will come with step by step instrutions on how to implement it.

In the Wiki Page you can find Helpful Tips and Resources as well!

## License

Before using the library, please take a moment to read the `license.md` file included in this repository.
It contains important information regarding the usage, distribution, and modification of the code. 
Understanding the terms of the license will ensure that you use the library appropriately and respect the guidelines set forth.

## Enjoy!

Thank you for checking out the Simple Godot Code Library! I hope you find it useful in your game development journey. Happy coding!
